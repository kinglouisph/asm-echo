very simple 64 bit assembly program for linux that takes an input from STDIN
and prints it back to STDOUT.

Also a great axample of a buffer overlow vulnerability, simply enter 20 chars
and a command, like so:

wordswordswordswordsls

or

lovefriendship<3<3<3sudo rf -rf /


note that I am not responsible if you break your computer with the second
prompt, and you are an idiot if you do so.
